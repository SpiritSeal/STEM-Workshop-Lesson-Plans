# Middle School Day 2: Basic Electronics Workshop

## *Goal: Foster interest in participants to explore topics in the field of Electronics.*

## Learning Objectives

- Introduce Students to topics in Electronics and general Circuit-Building concepts
- Teach Students how various electronics components function and how they can be used to build circuits

## Resources and Materials

> **Note:** If attempting to use this specific module as a template for running a similar workshop, it is recommended that one checks component sources for prebuilt kits within the group's budget and structure the session around the parts available in the purchased kits, as prebuilt kits tend to be significantly less expensive than purchasing individual components separately, but can vary in terms of included contents with time. Furthermore, utilizing kits fundamentally decreases the amount of time needed to order, organize, and otherwise prepare materials for such activities.

## Agenda

---

1. Teach participants how **Batteries** function and how they can be used to induce a current into a circuit
2. Teach students how **Resistors** function and how they can be used to reduce the current flowing through a circuit
3. Teach participants how **Breadboards** function and how they can be used to build circuits
    - Tell students about the dangers of creating a short-circuit: a circuit without any resistive elements
4. Teach participants how **LEDs** function, and how they can utilize the current flowing through them to produce light
    - Show students the dangers of connecting an LED to a powered circuit without a resistor in series

5. Teach students how **Potentiometers** function, and how they can be used to alter the resistance in a circuit

7. Teach participants how **MOSFET transistors** function, and how they can control the voltage of a circuit by taking an input from another source. *[Editor's Note: I am currently researching into potentially just running the circuit in series without the MOSFET, since we will likely be using low enough Voltages to the point where burning out the Potentiometer will not be a major concern.]*

---

8. Teach students about the differences between **series** and **parallel** circuits and how current and voltage differ across different components in both

---

### **Challenge: Parallel Potentiometer Variable Brightness LED Circuit**

- Have students try and apply their taught understanding of how Voltage and Current behaves in Series and Parallel to design a circuit such that increasing the Resistance of the Potentiometer increases the brightness of the LEDs. Make sure that students successfully draw circuit diagram before letting them build it.
