# Middle School Day 2: Electronics Workshop
## Learning Objectives:
- Introduce Students to topics in Electronics and general Circuit-Building
## Resources and Materials:
##### Note: If attempting to use this specific module as a template for running a similar workshop, it is recomended that one checks component sources for prebuilt kits within the group's budget and structure the session around the parts avaliable in the purchased kits, as prebuilt kits tend to be significantly less expensive than purchasing individual components separately, but can vary in terms of included contents with time. Furthermore, utilizing kits fundamentally decreases the amount of time needed to order, organize, and otherwise prepare materials for such activities.

## Projects
1. Simple Battery-Resistor-LED circuit
2. Variable Brightness LED using Potentiometer in Series
    - `Time-permitting`: Variable Brightness LED using Potentiometer in Parallel
3. Simple Motor circuit
4. [Variable Motor circuit](https://youtu.be/qmeENqruvZs?t=13)
