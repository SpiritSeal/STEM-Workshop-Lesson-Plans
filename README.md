# STEM Workshop Lesson Plans

Lesson Plans for workshops built to foster interest in STEM fields, particularly in Technology and Engineering, that I created over the course of my Eagle Project.

If you have a question about this or would like to make a suggestion, feel free to open an issue.

You can find the slideshows that were built from adapted versions of these materials here: https://bit.ly/ASANowSTEMSlides

This is currently a work in progress. See [progress.csv](progress.csv)
