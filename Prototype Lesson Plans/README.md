# Prototype Lesson Plans

This is where I planned out early versions of the workshops before I created the [instructional material slideshows](). These are not intended to be used as-is, especially given that the curricula and organization changed drastically once I invited collaborators to help me turn these rough sketches into usable, engaging teaching materials. Consider this folder and archival reference of how I started brainstorming/ planning out the workshops during the initial phases of the project.
